# iosSettings
iosSettings is a dummy of the official ios settings app.

In this app i have learned and tested the navigation controllers and detail view controllers as application for the SPLIT view app functionality in devices with bigger screens like the ipads and iphone plus size

Based on Master-Detail app Layout

Every asset and resource used in this app is for educational purpose.
